    <h2>What does it mean to be a fiend?</h2>
    <aside>
        <p>The volume (heh) of  Music out there in the world, on the internet even, is an ocean of inconceivable magnitude. As <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAcjV60RnRw&list=UU6nSFpj9HTCZ5t-N3Rm3-HA">this dude</a> explains, there exist more permutation of music than any mortal being could imagine discovering.</p>
        <p>Granted, probably 90% of it sucks. That's where music fiend comes in. Some people partition their tastes to just rap, or just classic rock.</p>
        <p>For a moment, Imagine your capacity for appreciating music going up 200%, just because you decided maybe there are more genres out there worth checking out.</p>
        <p>Here at music fiend, we  encourage our members to explore music they wouldn't normally expect to like. SO many people out there are trapped in a music box.</p>
        <p>They're convinced a certain genre music sounds like this or that, regardless of whether or not they've heard it This website aims to change that.</p>
